Unnecessarily Extremely high pressure environment.0% job security.worst work culture.They don't give leave.I was COVID positive and was having 103 F fever.They didn't give me leave untill I gave them my reports.They manipulate you by saying shrinkage target.Even if someone is dead in your family.They will give this shrinkage nonsense.Growth in this process is like mission impossible.They lure you by their sweet talk in initial days but after some time they show their true colours.This process is very much infamous in Amazon itself.Other processes don't even consider this process.If you think that you will take internal transfer after sometime,then it is not possible.No one even call you back.I literally wasted my whole year over here.Guys please do not apply for this role.Its a trap.you will think that it's ok it's amazon,but you are just gonna waste your time and energy over here and if you join her just say goodbye to you mental health.\n",

      "41.0: When you join they will treat you well for 2-3 months but after that, they will show their true colours. Enormous work pressure and you will be forced to achieve their customer satisfaction goals which are way beyond achievable. Jeff wants Amazon to be the world's most customer eccentric company but don't want to pay for it. Compensation is way below the market standards. There is no chance for growth even some of the managers agreed on. They will change your shift and schedule whenever they want and they always had the same answer for this \"Business requirement\".  They always say we will listen to issues and they do listen after making changes which certainly makes their employee's life hell. I think Amazon is just exploiting Indians and taking advantage of cheap labour\n",

I kept following up and finally they came up with an email stating that I’m not eligible for rehire! I asked them the reasons and all the reasons they gave were not true. I wrote back to them with the proper reasons and attachments and proofs telling that their reasons are all not true at all! After so many follow ups, the finally put me to HRBP team! And this team never responded to me there after! I followed up for almost 3 months and finally I had to give up! I had never expected this kind of response from such a huge company like AMAZON! More over I was my dream company and I loved everything about the company even when I was working in the company.. But what happened to me in the end is ready very bad I hope this doesn’t happen to any other person who loves Amazon!\n",

There will be stagnation in the work post 1.5 years and you do repeated work day by day. Promotion criteria in Amazon is too strict and they need to reevaluate it. Salary compensation is too low for such a huge workload and because of low base pay the hike doesn't make much difference.\n",
